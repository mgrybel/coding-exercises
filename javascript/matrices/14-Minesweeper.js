// Write a program that reads an m x n matrix, indicating the location
// where there are mines in a Minesweeper game (being 0 for a neutral field,
// and 1 for locations where there would be mines), and the program should
// return a matrix indicating, for each position, the number of mines
// in neighboring houses.
