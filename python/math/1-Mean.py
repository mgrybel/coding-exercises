# Write a program that calculates the arithmetic mean of two numbers.

# Prompt the user for two numbers
number1 = float(input('Enter the first number: '))
number2 = float(input('Enter the second number: '))

# Calculate the arithmetic mean
mean = (number1 + number2) / 2

# Display the arithmetic mean
print('The arithmetic mean:', mean)
