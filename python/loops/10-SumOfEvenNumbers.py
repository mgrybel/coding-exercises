# Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of
# even numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.

# Initialize variables

# Use a while loop to iterate until num reaches 100
while num <= 100:
  # Add the current number to the sum if it is even
  sum_of_evens += num

  # Increment the number by 2 to get the next even number
  num += 2

# Display the sum of even numbers
print("The sum of even numbers from 1 to 100 is:", sum_of_evens)
